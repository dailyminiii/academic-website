# about me
first-paragraph: I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <hightlight>Human-Centered Intelligent Systems (HCIS) Lab</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.gist.ac.kr/kr/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology at Gwangju, South Korea</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=huber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. SeungJun Kimr</a>
research-introduction: I am excited about creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that focus on people and expanding how we experience music and sports with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). A big part of my work is about using wearable sensors to collect a lot of data from people. This data is crucial for the AI systems I develop, which help give feedback to users, both in the real world and in virtual spaces. I aim to make the boundaries between technology and human experiences less distinct, leading to new and captivating ways for people to interact with technology.

research-interests:

  - field: SportsHCI
    subfields: Racket sports training, AI-based motion guidance generation
  
  - field: Autonomous Vehicle
    subfields: XR-based AV simulation, Risky simulation
