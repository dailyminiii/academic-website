# about me
first-paragraph: I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gist-hcis-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human-Centered Intelligent Systems (HCIS) Lab</a> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.gist.ac.kr/kr/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) at Gwangju, South Korea</a>, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=AjfRd6wAAAAJ&hl=ko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. SeungJun Kim</a>.

research-introduction: I design interactive AI systems that respond to the human body and behavior in real time. My work combines multimodal sensing—including muscle activity, movement, gaze, and physiological states—with adaptive feedback to support learning, engagement, and decision-making. I apply this approach across domains such as sports training, accessibility for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and human-vehicle interaction in autonomous driving. In these contexts, where expert instruction or hands-on experience may be limited, I aim to build systems that lower barriers to learning and promote embodied, inclusive, and personalized interaction. Looking ahead, I plan to establish the Smart Multimodal Wearable (SMW) Lab to continue exploring how sensing, feedback, and human-centered AI can expand opportunities for meaningful learning and support.
