research-introduction: I am excited about creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that focus on people and expanding how we experience music and sports with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). A big part of my work is about using wearable sensors to collect a lot of data from people. This data is crucial for the AI systems I develop, which help give feedback to users, both in the real world and in virtual spaces. I aim to make the boundaries between technology and human experiences less distinct, leading to new and captivating ways for people to interact with technology.
